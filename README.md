# Kidney Transplant Risk Calculator

## Description ##
Rejection occurs when a patient's body reacts to foreign proteins in a transplanted kidney. Each patient has unique medical history and circumstances that can affect their immune system's response. Pediatric cases have additional complexities like immature immune systems, size mismatch, and medication adherence. Using adult cases to judge pediatric patients in kidney transplantation can be misleading.
How can we quickly determine if patients from different age groups will experience kidney rejection after transplantation?
Our Kidney Transplant Risk Calculator offers a convenient solution for medical scientists! Whether it's an adult or a child, our calculator instantly analyzes gene expression data to assess the risk of transplant rejection. It also allows for quick comparison between adult and pediatric cases. By uploading a patient's gene expression data, you can assess the risk associated with kidney transplantation more effectively.

## Installation ##
In order to use our shiny app, you need to download the entire "Shiny" folder and run the "ui.R" file in the folder.

## Usage ##
The user can upload csv file of a patient's gene expression data, and click the calculate button in order to get the results: risk score, outcome, and top 5 genes boxplot. The user can also see the database, statistics of database, comparison analysis between adult and pediatric patients.
Further detailed instruction of usage are in the application.
